All files in this directory (`src/protobufs`) are generated protocol buffers from the Meshtastic® firmware,
which are found [here](https://github.com/meshtastic/protobufs).

I renamed the "meshtastic" directory, which was the directory that the original protocol buffers used, to
"protobufs" and have not made any further modifications to them to keep consistency for "feathermesh" and the
Meshtastic® firmware.
