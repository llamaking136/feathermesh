I, llamaking136, am not affiliated with Meshtastic LLC or their projects. My projects, including "feathermesh"
and I are independent; however, for "feathermesh" to communicate with other mesh nodes that use Meshtastic®
firmware, it relies on the firmware's protocol buffers (or protobufs) which can be found [here](https://github.com/meshtastic/protobufs)
to relay communication within a mesh network.

All other code, except that in the `src/protobufs` directory, is written by me and under license of the GPL-v3
license. Please see `src/protobufs/INFO` for more details regarding the protobufs.
